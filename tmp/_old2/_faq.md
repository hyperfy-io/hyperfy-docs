# FAQ

## General

### What is Hyperfy?

Hyperfy is a metaverse engine and platform powered by the Ethereum Blockchain. Holders of a Hyperfy World NFT own their own world in the metaverse that they can customize and invite others over to build, socialize, play or shop.

### What platforms do you support?

Hyperfy is available instantly from any web browser including mobile and standalone VR headsets such as the Meta Quest 2.

### Is Hyperfy just for galleries?

Hyperfy is a **complete** metaverse solution. We have easy to use tools for any skill level from simply displaying your NFTs, sharing your 3D architecture and designs, all the way up to coding your own interactive multiplayer games, live events or crypto-enabled stores.

### How do I get a world?

Worlds can be minted on [hyperfy.io](https://hyperfy.io) or you can buy pre-made worlds from the community on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/hyperfy). If you hold an NFT then you automatically own the corresponding world which will show up at [hyperfy.io/worlds](https://hyperfy.io/worlds).

### Do I have to code to use my world?

Nope! If you have NFT art or metaverse-ready assets in your wallet you can drop them into the world in a single click. You can also drag and drop most media files from your computer directly into the world, including 3D models.

### What if I can code?

If you can code, you automatically unlock another layer to your world. Using our SDK you can build highly dynamic and interactive apps including games and crypto-enabled stores.

### Can I easily customize pre-made worlds purchased on OpenSea?

Yes! You can place NFTs and custom media on top of any world using the editor. World builders also have the ability to offer you dynamic worlds that let you toggle features on/off and switch between different layouts to suit your needs.

### How do people visit my world?

Each world has its own link in the format **hyperfy.io/<slug\>** which you can change at any time.

### Can I limit access to my world?

By default your world is public but you can choose to token-gate your world, requiring guests to own a certain NFT to enter.

### What is the SDK?

The SDK lets you build fully interactive and dynamic apps locally on your computer, and then you can upload them to use in your worlds on Hyperfy.

Apps are built using React, the most popular and modern web development framework. We have a custom built metaverse renderer that lets you write declarative worlds using simple primitives such as `<model>` and `<skybox>` and behind the scenes we take care of all the hard stuff: state synchronization, auth, multiplayer, voice-chat, physics, scaling and more. Focus on your goals while we take care of everything else.

### Can I develop and sell worlds?

yes! If you own a world and list it on OpenSea, all apps embedded in that world are transferred to the newowner. We automatically update NFT metadata for your listing on OpenSea to match the image, title and description of your world. Everything in your world is completely transferrable.
