# Overview

Hyperfy is a virtual universe on the web made up of 13,000 limitless, interconnected spaces. Each space is built and governed by it's owner, with no limitations on content, design or mechanics. 

The Hyperfy SDK gives builders simple metaverse primitives using a modern web based stack (React and JavaScript) that can be used to create anything imaginable. Builders simply focus on the style and interactivity of their spaces and we take care of the rest.

Behind the scenes, Hyperfy's metaverse engine automatically handles authentication, multiplayer, scaling, text and voice chat, physics and avatars that can interact, fly, glide and climb in spaces. 

On top of this, Hyperfy spaces can be accessed from **any web browser** including phones and VR on Oculus Quest.

We are building metaverse-ready infrastructure that is both simple to use and extremely powerful. Nothing quite like it exists!

## Who can create a Space?

If you own a Hyperfy World NFT you are able to build and deploy your world to Hyperfy at any time. 

There will only ever be 13,000 worlds available for people to own. The World Presale will release a number of worlds at a discounted price and the rest will be sold slowly in batches as a public sale with a regular price.

Leading up to the World Presale event we will be giving away Hyperfy World NFT's to early supporters and talented builders.

Make sure to follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hyperfy_io) for news and updates.


## What skills do I need?

We will be launching a No-Code World Builder that anyone can use in the near future, but for now builders will need to use the SDK which requires a basic understanding of JavaScript.

Building World's with the SDK is similar to building a website, in fact we find it's even easier. If you have ever built something simple using React you should be ready to go.

## What can I build on my World?

Anything?! Building a World on Hyperfy is just like building a website. You can choose to build a simple world with a few 3D models and some NFT art, or you can build a hugely rich and interactive world with games, quests, crypto-shops and live events all in a single world:

- Virtual Homes
- Galleries
- Live Events
- Escape Rooms
- Parkour Maps
- Quest Hubs
- Shops & Malls
- Communities

Remember that Worlds in Hyperfy are limitless in size, so you can build as many of these things in your world as you want.

## Do Worlds have utility?

We want to enable everyone to create worlds with or without code, and we want to offer as much utility to world owners as possible to foster creativity and a thriving universe.

We have a lot of plans but here are a few of our short term goals:

- No-Code World Builder
- Play 2 Earn / World Token Emissions
- Token Airdrops
- World Renting & Subleasing
