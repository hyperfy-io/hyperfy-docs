# Getting Started

It's easy to get up and running with your own virtual world in the metaverse:

1. Visit [hyperfy.io](https://hyperfy.io) to mint a world or buy one on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/hyperfy).
2. Your worlds will show up at [hyperfy.io/worlds](https://hyperfy.io/worlds). Newly minted worlds can take a while to sync up so you may need to wait a few minutes.
3. Clicking your world will take you straight into it.
4. Hit `Tab` to open the editor and make changes to your world in realtime.

Congrats! You are now the proud owner of your own world in the metaverse!
