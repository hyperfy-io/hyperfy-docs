# Quick Start

To get started you'll need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) + [Npm/Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/). We recommend using NodeJS `v16.14.2` as this is the version we build and test with. If you are on a Windows operating system you may have trouble install/deploying without having [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (Windows Subsystem for Linux 1 or 2) installed on your machine. A utility like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) allows you to quickly switch between different versions of node.

The easiest way to get started with the SDK is by initializing a new project using `npx`:

```bash
npx hyperfy create quickstart
```

This will create a directory containing the project with a demo app to get you started.

Navigate into the directory and launch the world:

```bash
cd quickstart
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:4000` in your browser. You should now be standing in a virtual world running locally on your machine!

Hit `Tab` to open the editor.

Your project comes with a demo app called `Treasure Chest` that you can add to the world. When you walk up to it and click on it, it opens.

Open `apps/treasure-chest/index.js` and change the `OPEN_CLOSE_SPEED` value from `0.5` to `2` and hit save. Your app will be updated and you'll see that the treasure chest now animates slower when opening/closing.

To test multiplayer, just open multiple browser tabs. Each tab will automatially be assigned its own guest account.


## Structure

Once you've created a new project it will look something like this:

```
my-project/
├─ apps/
│  ├─ treasure-chest/
│  │  ├─ assets/           models, images, audio, etc
|  |  |- src/              raw assets eg .blend
│  │  ├─ app.json          app metadata
│  │  ├─ secrets.json      app server-side secrets
│  │  ├─ index.js          script entrypoint
```

## Apps

Each app lives inside its own folder inside the `/apps` directory. They will be built when code is changed and in the browser you can bring them into the world to test from the editor, opened with the `Tab` key.

Everything added to a world in Hyperfy is an App. It is up to you if you want to create one giant app that holds your entire space or create many little apps that you can compose together and easily make changes in your live world using the editor.

To create another app it's easiest to just duplicate an existing one and edit the `app.json` to give it a new id and title etc. We have created a Github repository containing a collection of [Hyperfy Recipes](https://github.com/hyperfy-io/hyperfy-recipes) demonstrating how to build different apps using the Hyperfy SDK to get you started.

## Assets

All finalized models, sounds, videos or images you reference in your app should be placed in the `assets` folder. These files will be uploaded along with your code.

## Sources

You should store any raw source files like `.blend` and `.psd` in the `src` folder. These files won't be uploaded to Hyperfy but are useful if you want to use `git` and `git-lfs` to version control or share your project with others.

## Scripts

Each app requires a single `index.js` entrypoint. From there you can import any other js files in the app folder including other npm packages you have installed. 

Your scripts run on both the server and on each client's browser independently. The server is not a central authority and doesn't automatically synchronize script data between clients. The `hyperfy` package provides utilities for synchronizing data, accessing secrets on the server, and running server-only or client-only code. It also provides a bunch of useful utilities out of the box including `Vector3`, `DEG2RAD`, `tween`, etc. See the API Reference for more info.

## Metadata

The `app.json` file describes the app and its metadata.

```json title='app.json'
{
  "id": "fridge",
  "name": "Fridge",
  "description": "A fridge that opens and closes",
  "image": "image.png"
}
```

:::caution

It's important to choose a unique ID for your project, eg by prefixing it with your name or company. It may only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and hyphens.

## React

Apps in Hyperfy are built using the declarative power of React – But – instead of rendering to the DOM your app is being rendered into an automatic multiplayer virtual world. Instead of using DOM elements like `<div>` and `<p>` you have access to powerful new elements such as `<model>` and `<rigidbody>`.

Everything else is Just React™, with full access to component based design, hooks, context and the entire React and Javascript ecosystem.

Your apps `index.js` file should export a default React component that will be used as the entry point for your app.

The following is a simple app that displays a large field of grass:

<details>
<summary>Click to show code</summary>

```jsx
import React from "react";

export default function Grass() {
  return (
    <app>
      <rigidbody>
        <box size={[100, 0.1, 100]} color="green" />
      </rigidbody>
    </app>
  );
}
```
</details>

## Performance

Thanks to React, Hyperfy is able to take full advantage of a virtual dom and only update things that need updating. On top of this, React can schedule complex tasks to happen later at a more optimal time. This is something no other engine can compete with.

One thing we **must** be careful with, is identifying when to jump into imperative code.

A perfect example of this is when animating objects each frame. Instead of thrashing React with state updates, it's best to do this _outside_ of react state:

<details>
<summary>Click to show code</summary>

```jsx
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react'
import { useWorld, Vector3 } from 'hyperfy'

function MovingBox() {
  const ref = useRef()
  const world = useWorld()

  useEffect(() => {
    const box = ref.current
    const position = new Vector3()
// highlight-start
    return world.onUpdate(delta => {
      position.y += delta
      box.setPosition(position)
    })
// highlight-end
  }, [])

  return (
    <box ref={ref}>
  )
}
```
</details>

## Sync State

While you are free to use React's `useState` hooks in order to change things only for the current avatar, it's likely you'll want to have some or all of your state synchronized with all clients connected to the world so that everyone sees the same thing.

To do this, export a `getStore` function and then use the `useSyncState` hook to read and write to the distributed store.

The following example shows a cube that changes color when anyone clicks on it. The color change is observed by **everyone** in the world:

<details>
<summary>Click to show code</summary>

```jsx
import React from "react";
// highlight-next-line
import { useSyncState } from "hyperfy";

export default function ColorCube() {
// highlight-next-line
  const [color, dispatch] = useSyncState((state) => state.color);
  return (
    <app>
// highlight-next-line
      <box color={color} onPointerDown={() => dispatch("toggle")} />
    </app>
  );
}

const initialState = {
  color: "blue",
};

// highlight-start
export function getStore(state = initialState) {
  return {
    state,
    actions: {
      toggle(state) {
        state.color = state.color === "blue" ? "red" : "blue";
      },
    },
  };
}
// highlight-end
```
</details>

Synchronized state is inspired by the flux/redux pattern popular on the web, but instead of dispatching events locally they are distributed across all clients and the server.

While it may take a second to get used to we've found that this flow is far more efficient and superior to what most platforms do by syncing the component changes of every entity in the space each time they change. This is the ultimate flex for declarative programming that other 3D engines don't have access to.

## Uploading

Once you're happy with your app and want to use them in your actual world, you can upload them to Hyperfy with a single command.

## Checklist

1. Test your app to make sure it runs well on mobile, desktop and VR devices.
2. Make sure your `app.json` file has the correct metadata that you want.
3. Ensure any files you don't need uploaded are in your `src` folder, not your `assets` folder.

## Upload to Hyperfy

Ensure you are connected to Hyperfy. This will open a hyperfy web page, if you are already connected it will tell you to close your browser window, otherwise it will ask you to connect with WalletConnect or MetaMask:

```bash
npm run connect
```

Now build and upload your app, replacing `<id>` with the ID you specified in your `app.json` file:

```bash
npm run upload <id>
```

Once complete you can go to your live world, hit `Tab` to open the editor, click `Add` and switch to the `Uploads` tab where your uploaded apps will be shown.
