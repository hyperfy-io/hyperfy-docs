# Performance

There are no hard limits to how much you can put in your world, but there are a few guidelines on how to create worlds that run well on a wide range of devices.

## Stats

At any time you can bring up the performance stats of your world to get a better idea of what makes up your world.

## Recommendations

Trying to stay under our recommended maximums should give you a good experience on mobile, desktop and VR.

:::caution

Performance is a complex topic. Always start small, testing on different devices as you build out your world!

| ---------- | --------------- |
| Triangles  | 1,000,000       |
| Textures   | 11,000 x 11,000 |
| Draw Calls | 100             |
