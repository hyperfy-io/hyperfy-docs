- **Linear `Z`**: The change in velocity along the vertical axis over the particle's lifetime.
- **World Space**: `Yes` if the velocity changes are applied in the world coordinate system, `No` if they are applied in the emitter's local coordinate system.
- **Orbital `X`**: The orbital velocity around the X-axis, adding a rotational movement to the particles.
