## Apps

Everything in a world is an object we call an "App". Apps can be anything from a simple 3D model or image, all the way up to complex mini-games or interactive experiences.

We provide you with a collection of built-in apps that are ready to use. They allow you to construct all kinds of environments and add interactive elements, NPC's, quests, vehicles, shops and much more!

## Settings

The world tab lets you configure all the metadata and permissions for your world:

- Give your world an image, title and description
- Choose a custom URL, eg `hyperfy.io/my-cool-world`
- Switch between global or spatial voice chat
- Add collaborators and give them editing permission
- Choose how your world scales

## Saving Changes

Whenever you make changes to the apps in your world or change any of your settings, you should hit the Save button to make it permanent.

This allows you to experiment freely without worrying about making a mistake. If you do make a mistake, it will revert back to your last save point 10 seconds after everyone leaves.
